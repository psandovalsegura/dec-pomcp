# POMCP 1.1

This is the release of POMCP used in the NIPS 2010 paper
"Online Monte-Carlo Planning in Large POMDPs"
by David Silver and Joel Veness

Further decentralized extensions by Pedro Sandoval Segura


## How to Use
1. Install dependencies
2. Compile using `make`
3. Run `./src/pomcp` with necessary arguments

Typically, I run:
```
./src/pomcp --problem rocksample --size 7 --number 8 --verbose 1 --singlerun --numsimulations 10
```

### wxWidgets
1. Navigate to https://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Compiling_and_getting_started and follow directions
2. Follow the section on "Testing the installation" to check that it was properly installed
3. Don't forget to add the installed libraries to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environement variable

Note: This page https://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Autoconf helped in modifying the configure.ac file accordingly,
and in providing the steps to regenerate Makefiles.

### Adding new files
New files need to be added to Makefile.am so that they can be recognized. Running `make` right
after is not enough to compile the project. You need to also run
```
autoreconf -fi
./configure
make
```
from the ROOT of the dec-pomcp (NOT from within src/!)

*Note*: For some reason, sometimes `./configure` fails, and it's necessary to run `./configure --with-boost-libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` probably because I messed something up with linking to the boost library
